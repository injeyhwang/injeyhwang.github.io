          I&apos;ve recently returned from my 1 year sabbatical; traveling to 8
          countries, 31 cities, and 4 continents. Now I am looking for my next
          engineering role where I can build beautiful UI and create joyful user
          experiences.

        <p>
          Prior to my travels, I worked as a software engineer at ï£¿ and
          previously co-founded the nonprofit OpenMeal as a web frontend
          engineer. Before that, I graduated from Columbia University with a
          degree in Computer Science.

          When I&apos;m not coding, you can find me training for a marathon,
          traveling, or trying out new restaurants!
