        <p>
          I&apos;m a Software Engineer based out of San Francisco who likes to
          build UI/UX and solve problems with code. Right now, I am having fun
          building with Swift and SwiftUI!
        </p>
        <p>
          I&apos;ve recently returned from my 1 year sebbatical; traveling to 8
          countries, 31 cities, and 4 continents. Now I am looking for my next
          Software Engineering role where I can build with Swift and SwiftUI.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prior to my travels, I worked as a Software Engineer at ï£¿ and
          previously co-founded the nonprofit OpenMeal. Before that, I graduated
          from Columbia University with a degree in Computer Science.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I&apos;m not coding, you can find me training for a marathon,
          traveling, or trying out new restaurants!
