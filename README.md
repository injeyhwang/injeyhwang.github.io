# My Personal Website
Welcome to my Next.js 15 website styled with Tailwind CSS deployed to the web via
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)!

## Motivation
My Next.js personal website that I started working on June of 2025.

The purpose of building this Next.js app is to build and showcase my CV as well as to catch up with
the world of frontend technologies as I get back into finding a new job (the last major Next.js
version I professionally worked with was 13).
